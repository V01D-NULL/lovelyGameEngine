# lovelyGameEngine
My attempt at a 2D game engine.
This may, or may not turn into a disaster.

As of right now, lovelyGameEngine is JUST for me to learn how game engines work.

Who know's, maybe this will become more than an experiment!


### Language used:
I am using C++ to develop the game engine.

### Development enviornment:
- OS: Manjaro Linux

### External libs:
- (OpenGL)
- glfw
- glew
